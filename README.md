# BeMindful

This app basically clones the behaviour of [Awareness App](http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/), but since it's missing the feature to display a notification insead of playing a sound, I've written this app.

BeMindful places itself in the menubar and shows the time you've been active in minutes and hours. Each active hour you'll be asked to take a pause. After a 5 minute pause the active time resets.

## ToDo
- Configure the pause time
- Configure the notification time
